# credit_SICR_mortgage_uk_ifrs9_na_na_prime_v1

This is end-to-end Python example that implements an IFRS 9 SICR (Significant Increase in Credit Risk) determination model for a mortgages portfolio. In this example we simulate a portfolio where each account has an origination PD and a current PD (measured at reporting date). We also simulate a SICR flag (i.e. Stage 2) based on a (hidden) quantitative limit. Then, using two candidate tests—one based on the absolute increase in PD and one on the ratio of current to origination PD—we run a grid search over candidate thresholds. For each candidate threshold we compute the confusion matrix counts (true positives, true negatives, false positives, false negatives) and use these to calculate the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). In a real-life calibration exercise you would select the criterion (and its threshold) that maximizes MCC to ensure the best overall discrimination between accounts that have experienced a significant increase in credit risk and those that have not.
